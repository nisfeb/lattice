  // ── desktop: these commands live in the native File menu ─────────────────
  // The desktop window has a real menubar (desktop/src/main.rs). A "+ file"
  // button in the sidebar sitting next to a File > New page menu item is the
  // same command offered twice, in the one place a desktop user is least
  // likely to look for it.
  //
  // HIDDEN, never removed. The menu works by clicking these very elements, so
  // there is exactly one implementation of "new page" and no Rust counterpart
  // to drift out of step. Removing them would take their handlers with them.
  //
  // Web and mobile are untouched: without the desktop shell there is no
  // menubar to move anything into, and the buttons are the only affordance.
